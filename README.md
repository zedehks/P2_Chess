# P2_Chess
Proyecto final para Programación II

Current Mission Objectives:
- Create the file management system (i.e. copy everything from "Battleship")
- Move game logic away from nasty JLabels and convert to sweet, dank classes and objects
- Finish by September 28 holy shit titty fuck
- Almost forgot: create more subfolders and organize files in them; so many files in a single folder trigger me so hard dam son.
- ...
- make more dank memes
